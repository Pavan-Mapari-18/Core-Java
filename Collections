Collections:

   An array has the drawbacks like:
   - fixed sized
   - Homogeneous objects
   - problem for grow
   - No predefined methods.
   
   To overcome such problem java introduced collection.

* Collection in java is the framework that provide an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

* In Java collection there are 10 important interface:
  1. Collection
  2. List
  3. Set
  4. Sorted Set
  5. Queue
  6. Map
  7. Sorted Map
  8. Navigable Set
  9. Navigable Map
  10. Iterable
-------------------------------------------
1. List Interface:
---------------------
      - Duplicate data allowed
      - Insertion order preserved
      - List interface is the part of java.util package and extends the Collection Framework.

    Methods of List Interface():
         add();  isEmpty();  remove();  size(); clear();

   * ArrayList() Methods:
         - Dynamic Sizing
         - Generic resizing
         - Automatic resizing
         - Iterable
         - Null values
         - Random Access
  * LinkedList methods():
     - LinkedList is a class that implements the List interface and represent a linked list data structure. Linked list implements doubly linked list.
     - Each node in a linked list repesent as a node contaning both data and refrence to the next and previous nodes

  * Vector


* for-each-loop:
         The for-each loop also known as the enhanced for loop it is use for iterating over elements in a collecction or array.
   Example:

-----------------------
2. Set Interface:
----------------
      - set is an interface in java collection framework that represents a collection of unique objects.
      - set does not allow duplicates entry.
      - order of elements is not preserved.
   
*Implementations:
            - HashSet: 
            - LinkedHashSet
            - TreeSet
